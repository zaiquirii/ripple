# Ripple

Ripple is a simple water/wave simulation with various visualizations built o top

It was made as a way for me to get back into graphics/simulation programming before tackling bigger projects and
as a test bed for some libraries I wanted to write. 

Namely: 
- Spline/tween library
- Animation library (using said spline/tween library)
